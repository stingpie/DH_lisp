Dollhouse is a scriptable p2p chat client. It is designed to be flexible to a ridiculous degree, to the point where you should be able to use it as a multiplayer game engine. It is super unfinished though. You can't really do anything right now. :/





### Design theory
Dollhouse is designed to encourage modular programming through automatically creating groups of mini-programs. Each mini-program serves a specific function, and is given a specific interface. Based on the function and interfaces, Dollhouse can select several mini-programs which would all waork together. 
This model allows Dollhouse to easily detect isomorphic structure on different machines, and combine them together when two peers connect (essentially creating a shared machine.)
